# Jekyll Port of Magnetic theme for my personal website.

Magnetic is a one page template with modern look and feel in mind based on the [original html5 theme](http://pixelhint.com/magnetic-free-html5-responsive-photography-website-template/).
I have used this html5 theme to make my own jekyll theme for my blog.

# Example Site

http://travel.abhishekbalam.xyz

# Features

* Image capable blog for documenting travels.
* Categories which are customisable for different types of travel.
* Map Feature - Where you can add coordinates to every place in a post and it shows up on a map , which makes it easy to navigate to for later perusing, or just to sit back and feel good about how far you travelled :)
